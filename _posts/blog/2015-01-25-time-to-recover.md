When it comes to your website availability, you can be sure about something: there will be downtime! Once you've invested your efforts on avoiding failures by setting up reliable systems, redundancy, failovers and backups, you'll need to focus on **time to recovery**.

By automating failover systems and monitoring main sites, after some minutes of key errors raising -need some time to deal with false positives-, your visitors traffic will fall back to redundant systems. Make sure those are ready to deal with real traffic, and you'll be minutes away to recover from any disaster. Great!

What would you do i.e. in case you lose a DB instance which you'll need over one hour to recover from disk image backups? This is where your effort clearly proves ROI: minimize as much as you can the time you need to recover from such a disaster.

Great operations teams even produce benchmarks on time to recovery which will keep business safe. In conclusion, focus on TTR as much as you do on avoiding the failures.
