Your IT team has grown from 4-5 developers to 15-20, there are several products to be built and stakeholders have decided to run all those projects in parallel.

When your team and product portfolio was small enough, you were following agile methodologies, running 1/2 weeks sprint along with whole dev team, and a single dev items list where everyone was working on. You want to keep same idea, but overhead is massive cause the group is too big: daily scrums start becoming inefficient and developers do not really focus due to context switching.

The straightaway solution will mean setting up small teams, arranged depending on skill sets, for each project. The problem is that scenario does not cope with risk and contingency at all, since any accident will mean blocking the related project.

A better approach is arranging **streams** in the following way:

* Protect those key projects and set up a specific team for them. Focus will increase efficiency and delivery speed for that team. You can implement something related to Scrum here so you bet for velocity.

* Merge several projects into stream(s) and arrange larger teams for these. There will be context switching and stakeholders will need to agree on priorities cross-projects, but you will reduce risks and deal with contingency like when you were a smaller team. You can implement Kanban-style so stakeholders can change plan in the middle of sprints.

* Keep business-as-usual tasks and bugs aside, into a different stream with a small team. Whereas important bugs will be part of their oen stream, minor bugs can be worked out in parallel hence not blocking main projects. Same for BaU stuff.

I believe three stream types above can scale up to larger teams, as long as you make sure teams on each stream holds skill sets for project delivery to happen.
